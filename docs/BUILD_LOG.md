## Session 1 — 2026-09-30

### Phase 0 — scaffold

**Built:** the Django project from the reference's conventions (`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`): one
settings module, the security block, request ids, CSP, the 413 guard, JSON-only Celery,
JWT-only DRF with cursor pagination and `{detail, code}` errors, drf-spectacular, the custom
`User` (email-keyed, `google_sub`, `plan`, `notes_revision`) in the first migration, and pgvector
enabled by migration. ruff, coverage, pre-commit, CI with a pgvector service, Dependabot and
`SECURITY.md`.

**What went wrong / notes:**

- PostgreSQL was not installed on the machine, and installing it needs sudo. For the session, the
  Ubuntu `postgresql-16` and `postgresql-16-pgvector` packages were unpacked (`apt-get download` +
  `dpkg -x`) into a private directory and run as the normal user on port 5433. The suite ran
  against that. **The README's native setup (apt install) is still the real path** and is untested
  on this machine until the owner runs it.
- Its Unix socket path was too long for Postgres (107-byte limit), so it listens on TCP only.
- The distro's pgvector is 0.6.0, which has HNSW (0.5.0+). Enough for the plan.
- CI has not run yet: the first push happens with this phase's tag.

**Left:** nothing in the phase. **Unsure:** coverage bar (D12).

### Phase 4a — evaluation fixtures

**Built:** `retrieval/eval/`: 30 TipTap fixture notes and 31 labelled questions (eight kinds,
including near-duplicate, multi-note and three no-answer questions), a loader that validates
both files into frozen dataclasses, and pure recall@k / MRR functions that score note-level
rankings (D41–D45). Draft "Evaluation" section in `docs/RAG_EVAL_DRAFT.md`, to be merged into
`docs/RAG.md`. No DB, no models: search is being built in parallel.

**What went wrong / notes:** nothing blocking. The fixtures were written with a throwaway
generator (not committed; the JSON is the source of truth, D41).

**Left:** `eval_retrieval` (needs search), a per-kind breakdown in its output, and the real
provider's numbers in the results table. **Unsure:** whether 31 questions are enough to separate
the modes — one question moves recall by ~3.6 points, so small differences are noise.
